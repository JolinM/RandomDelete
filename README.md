RandomDelete
============

Random delete tool for Illustrator.

Inspired by [RandomTools](http://scriptographer.org/scripts/general-scripts/randomtools/) from [kenfrederick](http://kenfrederick.com/)


Installation
-------

     1. Quit Illustrator
     2. Copy the files into the Illustrator application folder's "Presets" > "Scripts" subfolder
     3. After restarting Illustrator you can find the scripts in the menu "File" > "Scripts";

TIP: You can create subfolders in the scripts folder to organize your scripts (like they are organized here)

NOTE: Adopted from a guide by Wolfgang Reszel.
